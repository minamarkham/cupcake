Hi! I'm Mina, an Oakland-based design engineer. I write code for a living, currently as a Staff Engineer at Slack. My focus is on creating engaging & accessible digital experiences for humans.

I've been building stuff on the web for the last decade, creating some websites you may have seen. Previously at Hillary for America, my work on the Pantsuit pattern library has been spotlighted in [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/key-clintons-identity-online-pantsuit/), [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinawallace/2017/04/17/mina-markahm-is-a-sasstronaut/#2ca6ee847ac3), [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063367/hillarys-campaign-named-its-ui-pantsuit-perfectly), and [Communication Arts](https://www.commarts.com/columns/coding-a-pantsuit).

I [speak](/speaking/) at conferences worldwide, sharing my experience and expertise in a variety of topics such as design systems and CSS architecture.

Outside of work, I like ampersands, interior design, LEGOs, and the color pink. I graduated from [Syracuse University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_University) with a dual major in Graphic Arts from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications and Women’s Studies.
